# Rat-in-a-Maze
C Program for Rat in a Maze Problem
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.
In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
The problem is solved using backtracking.
